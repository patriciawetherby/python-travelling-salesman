# python-travelling-salesman
Python Data Structures project that uses a hash table and a nearest neighbor algorithm. 3 trucks piloted by 2 drivers are tasked to deliver 40 packages with
the address information and notes. The software uses a nearest neighbor algorithm to calculate a route for each of the trucks. The total
number of miles must be under 140. Packages have constraints such as known delays, address errors, multiple orders, and truck preferences that must be adhered to.
The screenshots show the package status at 3 given times.
